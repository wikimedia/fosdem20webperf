    <i>Auditing and Improving the Performance of Boomerang</i><br><br>
Boomerang is an open-source Real User Monitoring (RUM) JavaScript library used by thousands of websites to measure their visitor's experiences. The developers behind Boomerang take pride in building a reliable and performant third-party library that everyone can use without being concerned about its measurements affecting their site. We recently performed and shared an audit of Boomerang's performance, to help communicate its "cost of doing business", and in doing so we found several areas of code that we wanted to improve. We'll discuss how we performed the audit, some of the improvements we've made, how we're testing and validating our changes, and the real-time telemetry we capture for our library to ensure we're having as little of an impact as possible on the sites we're included on.<br><br>

    <i>How to measure SpeedIndex from raw encrypted packets, and why it matters</i><br><br>
The World Wide Web is still among the most prominent Internet applications. While the Web landscape has been in perpetual movement since the very beginning, these last few years have witnessed some noteworthy proposals such as SPDY, HTTP/2 and QUIC, which profoundly reshape the application-layer protocols family. To measure the impact of such changes, going beyond the classic W3C notion of page load time, a number of Web performance metrics has been proposed (such as SpeedIndex, Above-The-Fold and variants). At the same time, there is still a limited amount of understanding on how these metrics correlate with the user perception (e.g., such as user ratings, user-perceived page load time, etc.). In this talk, we discuss the state of the art in metrics and models for Web performance evaluation, and their correlation with user experience through several real-world studies.<br><br>

    <i>Fonts are lovely but can slow down our loads. How can we make them faster?</i><br><br>
We all love fonts. From Google Fonts to Typekit, Hoefler&Co and more, they give character and tone to our websites. The down side of fonts is that they can really slow down our loads. In this talk we'll learn about common pitfalls like critical requests depth and how to use resource hints to play tricks with latency to load web applications faster. We'll walk through a network profile to understand what's going on in the browser and how to make it faster.<br><br>
