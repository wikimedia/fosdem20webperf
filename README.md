This static site is generated using Jekyll (automated by GitHub pages).

## Requirements

* Ruby 2 (tested with Ruby 2.6.4)
* Bundler (if missing, install with `gem install bundler`)

## Getting started

Install Jekyll and `github-pages` plugins (first time only):

```shell
bundle install
```

To update Jekyll and any plugins (e.g. after making changes to `Gemfile`):

```shell
bundle update
```

Regenerate the site and serve locally at <http://127.0.0.1:4000/>:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
